path operations
use postman to test our APIs
extract data in post method
.............def create_posts(payload:dict = Body(...)):
The pain
1. It is pain to get all the values from the body
2. The client can send whatever data they want
3. The data isn't getting validated
4. We ultimately want to force the client to send the data in a scheme that we expect

That's why we need schema
we can use pydantic to define the schema -- this is already installed during fastapi installation
from pydantic import BaseModel
we can define a class for our data where we define the keys and what types of values it should contain
order matters in APIs
